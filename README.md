## FastAPI Doc HTTP Response

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tharlesamaro/fastapi-doc-http-response/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=VAY93FNZCA)](https://codecov.io/gh/tharlesamaro/fastapi-doc-http-response)

FastAPI Doc HTTP Response is a Python package that facilitates the definition of standard HTTP responses for FastAPI APIs and allows for easy addition of HTTP returns to the API documentation. With this package, you can easily create standard responses for the most common HTTP status codes.

FastAPI provides automatic documentation for your routes, including the expected HTTP responses for each route. By default, FastAPI only includes a few HTTP return codes in the documentation. With FastAPI Doc HTTP Response, you can easily add other HTTP return codes, ensuring that your API documentation is complete and accurate.

### Installation

You can install FastAPI Doc HTTP Response using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi-doc-http-response
```

### Usage

To use FastAPI Doc HTTP Response in your FastAPI application, simply import the `get_responses` function from the package and call it with a list of HTTP status codes that you want to define:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_doc_http_response import get_responses

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/xpto", responses=get_responses(201, 400, 401, 403))
async def xpto():
    # ...
```

The code above will define the following standard HTTP responses for the `/xpto` route:

- 201 Created
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden

These return codes will also be automatically added to the API documentation generated by FastAPI.

Note that it is not necessary to define an HTTP return code for the 200 OK and 422 Unprocessable Entity statuses, as they are already defined by default by FastAPI.
